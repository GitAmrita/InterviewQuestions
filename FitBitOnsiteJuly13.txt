1. Find the max Sum from the root to the leaf.Here 3 is shared between right of 2 and left 
of 7.
		1
	2		7
    5            3            9

2. a-b-c-d are networks, a can send message -val only to next node and b can receive from left 
and right both. Implement Receive methods to count the number to networks. Ans = 4
public abstract class direction{
	public void SendToRight(int val);
	public void SendToLeft(int val);
	public bool HasRight();
	public bool HasLeft();
	public void ReceiveFromRight(val);
	public void ReceiveFromLeft(val);		
}

3. Some sql question, create table and indexing

4.Common value sub tree : For a tree if root = left = right and all children are CVST as well
then it is a CVST.

5. How hash table works
